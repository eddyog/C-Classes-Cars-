It will compute the information base in what the user input is 

By creating a while loop the user can repeate the process until they decided to quit the program

The Progrm will have the following menu

Select Are and perimeter that you want to calculate
1) Square
2) Triangle 
3) Rectangle
My option = 

The Main purpose of the program is to demostrate my knowledge working with Classes and the different
ways that we can implemented into a program. The Classes have the following code: Methods Private and public, Default Constructors, Non-default Constructors. The use of string and pointers to access arrays.
